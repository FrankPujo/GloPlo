Simple functional language

## Function definition
Define functions with the "**funct**" keyword followed by the function name and the (one only one for the moment) variable.  
The next lines (with an indentation of 1 tab) define all the cases for which the function is run; use the "_" symbol to substitute _any_ case not considered.  

## Variable definition
Define a variable with its name preceded by its **type** and followed by "=" and its value.  
The value can be an integer (or an operation with integers) or a function called on another variable.
